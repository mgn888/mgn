          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What is a blockchain validator?" open>
            <p>
              A blockchain validator is a node operator that participates in the consensus mechanism of a blockchain network. Validators verify transactions, create new blocks, and help maintain network security. In return, they earn rewards in the form of cryptocurrency tokens.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Which blockchain networks do you support?">
            <p>
              We currently support major blockchain networks including Ethereum, Celestia, NEAR, Evmos, and Axelar. Our infrastructure is designed to be easily expandable to support new networks as they emerge.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
